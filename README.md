# snake-game

My take on the snake game.
User starts off as a 3 segmented snake.
Food is generated in a random position.
Whenever the snake "eats" the food, the snake's size, as
well as the score increases.
The game ends when the snake touches the border, or 
touches one of its segments with its head.
